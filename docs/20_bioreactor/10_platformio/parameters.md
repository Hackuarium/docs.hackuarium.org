# Parameters

All the functionalities and the communication between processes is ensured by a common list of parameters.
The first 26 parameters (A -> Z) will be saved regularly in the log. These values will be recovered when the bioreactor reboots.

# State machine

There are 3 important variables that will manage the state of the bioreactor:

- PARAM_STATUS : the current status of the bioreactor
- PARAM_ERROR : if there is any error in one of the processes
- PARAM_ENABLED : the functions that are currently enabled

The `PARAM_ENABLED (Z)` will allow to activate or deactivate some function of the bioreactor. It is for example possible to disable heating while keeping all the other functionalities active.

## PARAM_STATUS

`PARAM_STATUS` will display the currently active functionalities. It is composed of different bits that can
be enabled or disabled using the method `start` and `stop`. You may also check the status of one of the functions using `getStatus`.

| BIT | PARAM_STATUS         | COMMENT                                                          |
| --- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0   | FLAG_PID_CONTROL     | enable/disable heating                                           |
| 1   | FLAG_STEPPER_CONTROL | enable/disable agitation control                                 |
| 2   | FLAG_FOOD_CONTROL    | enable/disable food control                                      |
| 3   | FLAG_PH_CONTROL      | enable/disable pH control                                        |
| 4   | FLAG_GAS_CONTROL     | enable/disable gas control                                       |
| 5   | FLAG_SEDIMENTATION   | enable/disable sedimentation (one of the phases of food control) |
| 6   | FLAG_RELAY_FILLING   | enable/disable filling pump (one of the phases of food control)  |
| 7   | FLAG_RELAY_EMPTYING  | enable/disable emptying pump (one of the phases of food control) |
| 8   | FLAG_PH_CALIBRATE    | enable/disable pH calibration                                    |
| 9   | FLAG_RELAY_ACID      | enable/disable acid addition                                     |
| 10  | FLAG_RELAY_BASE      | enable/disable base addition                                     |

The status is currently the `AZ` parameter. You can change the status by changing this value. For example
if you want to force the bioreactor to go in the emptying state you should ensure that the bits `FLAG_FOOD_CONTROL` & `FLAG_RELAY_EMPTYING` are set. In other words, you may have to add 2^2 (4) + 2^9 (512) = 516 to your value of the parameter `AZ` (in the case it was not yet enabled). Same procedure is to be implemented for filling.

## PARAM_ENABLED

`PARAM_ENABLED` allows to enable or disable some functionalities of the bioreactor. Currently, it can control heating, food control and agitation.

| BIT | PARAM_STATUS         | COMMENT                          |
| --- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 0   | FLAG_PID_CONTROL     | enable/disable heating           |
| 1   | FLAG_STEPPER_CONTROL | enable/disable agitation control |
| 2   | FLAG_OUTPUT_1        | enable/disable food control      |
| 3   | FLAG_OUTPUT_2        | enable/disable food control      |
| 4   | FLAG_OUTPUT_3        | enable/disable food control      |
| 5   | FLAG_OUTPUT_4        | enable/disable food control      |

If you want to control everything the value of `PARAM_ENABLED` should be 63.

## PARAM_ERROR

| BIT | PARAM_ERROR                  | COMMENT                                                    |

| 2   | FLAG_TEMP_LIQ_PROBE2_ERROR   | Liquid probe in the bottom failed (one wire not answering) |
| 3   | FLAG_TEMP_PCB_RANGE_ERROR    | Temperature of pcb is outside range                        |
| 4   | FLAG_TEMP_LIQ_RANGE1_ERROR   | Temperature of liquid in the top is outside range          |
| 5   | FLAG_TEMP_LIQ_RANGE2_ERROR   | Temperature of liquid in the bottom is outside range       |
| 6   | FLAG_TEMP_TARGET_RANGE_ERROR | Target temperature is outside range                        |
| 7   | FLAG_WEIGHT_RANGE_ERROR      | Weight is outside range                                    |
