# Goal of the project

This project was done at the [Hackuarium](http://www.hackuarium.ch/en/) association, a DIY biology hacking-space and open laboratory located in Ecublens (Switzerland). Feel free to [contact us](https://form.jotformeu.com/71600609780354) if you would like additional information or would like to buy a fully built and tested spectrophotometer.

Recently, the open-source and open-hardware community has been involved in the creation of open scientific tools. In this context, a few spectrophotometer projects emerged. However, none of them was sufficiently evolved to be casually used in a laboratory. It is for this reason that we started this project.
Our goal was to create a simple spectrophotometer that measures the
absorbance of a sample for 3 different light colors (red, green, blue), that is
self-contained (battery powered) and displays the result on a LCD screen. In addition, the tool had to be reliable, precise and cheap.

The initial idea was that you could teach spectrophotometry without
having to buy an expensive instrument, since you can find experiments
that do not require a specific light wavelength. This includes
optical density for bacteria culture, determination of a pigment's concentration in
a solution, determination of the kinetic of a reaction and many others.

The device is rather cheap, for you can buy all the components on AliExpress
(but one) and either 3D print or laser cut the case (MDF or acrylic glass). When constructing 10, the price
per spectrophotometer is around $30. However if you want to have a final
product with an aluminium case and PCBs already assembled, the cost would rather be $90 each if you order 20 of them.
