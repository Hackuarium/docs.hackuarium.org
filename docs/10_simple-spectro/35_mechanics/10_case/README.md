# The case

The case was designed using FreeCAD and OpenSCAD. These programs look rather complex at a first glance but have the huge advantage that all the parameters may be set in an internal spreadsheet. This allows to design parametric values that can be easily changed and updated.

Currently we have 3 versions of the case:

- The open-box can be easily opened to understand the way the spectro works.
- A box that is designed to be cut using a laser cutter in 3mm MDF or acrylic glass.
- The closed-box is designed for the top and bottom parts to be screwed together. It can be made by aluminium milling (or can also be 3D-printed).
