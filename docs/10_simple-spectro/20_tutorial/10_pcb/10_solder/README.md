# Soldering the board

The PCB comes presoldered with all the surface mounted components.

However, all the through hole components have to be soldered by hand.

:::caution
Please take care about the face on which you need to solder the components!
:::

The goal is to reach this final result:

## Bottom face

On this face we need to solder:

- Blue LED
- RGB common cathode LED
- TSL237 light to frequency convertor
- Socket for battery
- 10k potentiometer for LCD contrast tuning

### LEDs and TSL237

Please take care of the orientation of the components!
For the LEDs there is a flat side that should be oriented like the symbol printed on the board indicates.
For the light sensor (TSL237) the protrusion should points towards the RGB LED.

### Potentiometer

The potentiometer should be soldered on the bottom face of the PCB as well.

### Battery socket

The socket for the rechargeable battery must be oriented correctly. Generally, the slit points outwards.

**IMPORTANT !!! Some batteries have the connector inverted !** Please check your battery so that the red and black cables
are oriented like on the following picture.

## Upper face

The LCD is solder onto the board using a single row straight strip pin header. Is is easier to first solder the LCD screen using the smaller part of the pins.

**Note:** Finishing soldering the rotary push button and the screen may be easier if the PCB is already placed in the case. This ensures the alignment of the components.

## Rotary push button

Finally you will solder the rotary push button on the top (same as the LCD screen).
