# Assembling the case

The case parts can be found in bag C, as well as all the screws that will be used to assemble it. We use nylon screws, because they are inexpensive, non-conductive, and can be cut easily to a desired length. Here is a list of the parts found in bag C:

1. 4 x 15mm M3 screws
2. 4 x male to female(MF) M3 spacers of 8mm height
3. 4 x 8mm M3 screws
4. 4 x female to female (FF) M3 spacers of 10mm height
5. A piece of VelcroÂ®
6. Top of the case
7. Shorter sides of the case
8. The battery
9. Bottom of the case
10. Longer sides of the case
11. All four sides of the cell well

## 1) Small screws and MF spacers on top

Screw the short M3 screws in the male to female spacers on the top face of the case. Be sure that you're doing it so that the PCB will fit afterwards (verify the orientation of the top).

## 2) Fix PCB on top face using FF spacers

Place the PCB on the male part of the MF spacers so that the screen and the button are well aligned with the corresponding holes. Fix the PCB in place using the FF spacers.

## 3) Assemble cell well

The order of the cell well is important! You should laid them out flat like on the first picture and then assemble them in volume.

:::tip
Use the screwdriver to gently push the parts of the well so that they enter in the bottom face hole. This can be a tricky. Just be a bit patient.
