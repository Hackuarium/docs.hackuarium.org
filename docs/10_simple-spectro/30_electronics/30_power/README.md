# Battery

The spectro includes a rechargeable battery and display on the home screen the current voltage. We advice
not go go under 4V and to recharge regularly (at least once every 3 months if not used) the battery using a USB cable during one night. The charged battery will display a voltage of around 4.3V.

The circuit dealing with battery management is largely inspired by the [application note](power-design.pdf) from microchip.

The evolution of the battery status can be measured directly by the spectrophotometer.
