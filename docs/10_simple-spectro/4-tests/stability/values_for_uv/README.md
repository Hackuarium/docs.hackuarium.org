# Test measures for UV

We made different measures to see how much energy was received by the captor in the presence of a tank full of water, or with no tank. We obtained those results:

|      | Without tank | With tank + H2O |
| ---- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Mean | 16255,9      | 12492,2         |
| SD   | 18,82        | 19,53           |
