# Goal of the project

This project was done at the [Hackuarium](http://www.hackuarium.ch/en/) association, a DIY biology hacking-space and open laboratory located in Ecublens (Switzerland). Feel free to [contact us](https://form.jotformeu.com/71600609780354) if you would like additional information or would like to buy a fully built and tested bioreactor.

Recently, the open-source and open-hardware community has been involved in the creation of open scientific tools. In this context, a few bioreactor projects emerged. However, none of them was sufficiently evolved to be casually used in a laboratory. It is for this reason that we started this project.

Our goal was to create a simple pHMeter and conductometer reliable, precise and cheap.
